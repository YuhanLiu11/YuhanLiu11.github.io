I'm a second-year PhD student in the Department of CS at University of Chicago, advised by Prof. Junchen Jiang and Prof. Shan Lu. My research interest is Systems/Software engineering for ML. 
I received my B.S. in CS at University of Wisconsin-Madison, fortunate to be advised by Prof. Shivaram Venkataraman.
